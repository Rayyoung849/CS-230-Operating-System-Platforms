# Module 5 - Project Two

## Overview

Evaluate Linux, macOS, Windows, and Mobile for a web based version of **Draw It or Lose It**. Complete the Software Design Template with server side, client side, and development tools findings.

## What I delivered

* Software Design Template with the **Evaluation** table for all four platforms
* Server side hosting and licensing notes
* Client side browser support and QA plan
* Development tools and team impact summary

## How to review

1. Open `project-2-software-design.docx`
2. See the **Evaluation** section for the table and notes

## Files

* `project-2-software-design.docx`

## Note

Next time, keep the tools section fully web first and mark native mobile toolchains as future work only. Also make sure the final platform recommendation matches the evidence in the table.
